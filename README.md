# KUMBAL card game rules and gameplay ♣️♦️♠️♥️

**Gameplay**
* At the start of each _round_, each player gets 7\* cards from the deck, and to start the game, the top card on the deck is placed face up on the discard pile.
* The objective of the _round_ is to discard as many points (card value) as possible and end up with 7 or fewer points in your hand.
    * Points: card value, i.e. joker=0, A=1, 2=2, ..., 9=9, 10=10, J=11, Q=12, K=13
* The _round_ ends when somebody calls "KUMBAL", the points are counted and added to those of the previous round
* The _game_ ends when the loser is the first to cross 100 points. The winner is the player with the fewest points. You can also continue for longer.

**Player turn**
   * 1. First discard from your hand, 
   * 2. Finish your turn by drawing a card from the deck or the top-facing card from the discard pile.
      * Jokers and action cards cannot be picked up from the discard pile; they are lost when played

**Discarding cards**
* You can discard _two or more of the same value_ (doubles, triples, etc e.g. ♣️9 + ♥️9...).
* You can discard a series of _three or more in the same suit_ (♣️4, ♣️5, ♣️6, ...)
   * joker can be played as another card (but cannot be picked up from the discard pile by next player, similar to action cards)

**Winning a round** 
* If,  at the beginning of your turn,  you have 7 or fewer points in your hand you may call "Kumbal". If you indeed have the fewest amount of points in hand after counting all hands, you win and get 0 penalty points, the rest gets the amount of penalty points held in hand. 
    * If another player has the same amount, or fewer points than the player who calls Kumbal, the one who called Kumbal gets the amount of points in hand plus 25 penalty points. 

* At the end of each round, all players scores are recorded and added up.
    * The game ends when one person's penalty score surpasses 100 points (or you can continue to 200 or 500 for longer games)
    * If a player's score reaches 49 points exactly, their score is reduced by 49 points to 0.
    * If a player's score reaches 99 points exactly, their score is reduced by 49 points to 50.
    * This increments for 149, 199, 249, 299 points etc each get reduced by 29 points. 
    * side note: it is theoretically possible to get to 99 points, have your number of points reduced by 49 to 50, lose the following round with a single joker in hand (-1 point) and then achieve 49 points, which brings you back to zero points. Whether this situation has actually been achieved remains hearsay.

**Action cards**
* When cards are played as an action card, they cannot be picked up from the discard pile, the following player has to pick from the deck.
   * Action cards:
      * 8: wait, next player in turn is skipped
      * 7: reverses play direction
      * pick up cards:
         * joker: next in play must pick up 5 cards
         * 2: next in play must pick up 2 cards

**Additional game tweaks**
* Special "action" cards have additional powers (note this is not recommended by the Kumball OG 'A' or the Peruvian girls who taught him) : 
   * 8: next person is skipped
   * 7: reverse playing direction
   * 2: next person to pick 2
   * joker: next person to pick 5
      * instead of picking up cards one can play a 2 or joker, in which case the number of cards to be picked up by the next player increases in kind
*  Free Discards (speeds things up): if you draw a card from the deck that has the same value as the top-facing card on the discard pile, you can discard it 'for free' as long as the next person hasn't played their turn yet.
* Cutting the deck (speeds things up): To speed up the game even more, instead of shuffling the deck between rounds, the deck can be 'cut' instead. Highly recommended as it adds predictability to drawn cards.


\*   *You can choose to play with 5 cards in hand with a goal of 5 points or fewer, to make the game faster (recommended for larger groups of more than five players)*

# KUMBAL card game rules and gameplay ♣️♦️♠️♥️

**Gameplay**
* At the start of each _round_, each player gets 7 cards from the deck, and to start the game, the top card on the deck is placed face up on the discard pile.
* The objective of the _round_ is to discard as many penalty points (card value) as possible and end up with 7 or fewer points in your hand.
    * Penalty points: card value, i.e. joker=0, A=1, 2=2, ..., 9=9, 10=10, J=11, Q=12, K=13
* The _round_ ends when somebody calls "KUMBAL", the points are counted and added to those of the previous round
* The _game_ ends after a few _rounds_ when the loser is the first to cross 100 penalty points. The winner is the player with the fewest points. You can also continue for longer.

**Player turn**
   * 1. Start by discarding from your hand
   * 2. End your turn by drawing a card from the deck or the top-facing card from the discard pile.

**Discarding cards**
* You can discard _two or more of the same value_ (doubles, triples, etc e.g. ♣️9 + ♥️9...).
* You can discard a series of _three or more in the same suit_ (♣️4, ♣️5, ♣️6, ...)
   * Jokers can be played as another card (but cannot be picked up from the discard pile by next player, similar to action cards)
* Jokers and action cards cannot be picked up from the discard pile; they are lost when played


**Winning a round** 
* If,  at the beginning of your turn,  you have 7 or fewer points in your hand you may call "Kumbal". If you indeed have the fewest amount of points in hand after counting all hands, you win and get 0 penalty points, the rest gets the amount of penalty points held in hand. 
    * If another player has the same amount, or fewer points than the player who calls Kumbal, the one who called Kumbal gets the amount of points in hand plus 25 penalty points. 

* At the end of each round, all players scores are recorded and added up.
    * The game ends when one person's penalty score surpasses 100 points (or you can continue to 200 or 500 for longer games)

**Action cards**
* When cards are played as an action card, they cannot be picked up from the discard pile, the following player has to pick from the deck.
   * Action cards:
      * 8: wait, next player in turn is skipped
      * 7: reverses play direction
      * pick up cards:
         * joker: next in play must pick up 5 cards
         * 2: next in play must pick up 2 cards
         * you don't have to pick up cards if you can play your own pick up card

**Additional game tweaks**
*  _Free Discards_ (speeds things up): if you draw a card from the deck that has the same value as the top-facing card on the discard pile, you can discard it 'for free' as long as the next person hasn't played their turn yet.
* _Cutting The Deck_ (speeds things up): To speed up the game even more, instead of shuffling the deck between rounds, the deck can be 'cut' instead. Highly recommended as it adds predictability to drawn cards.
* _Lower the Goal_ (5 instead of 7): You can choose to play with 5 cards in hand with a goal of 5 points or fewer, to make the game faster (recommended for larger groups of more than five players)
* _Action cards_: Special "action" cards have additional powers (note this is not recommended by the Kumball OG 'A' or the Peruvian girls who taught him) : 
   * 8: next person is skipped
   * 7: reverse playing direction
   * 2: next person to pick 2
   * joker: next person to pick 5
      * instead of picking up cards one can play a 2 or joker, in which case the number of cards to be picked up by the next player increases in kind
* _The 49-Rule_
   * If a player's score reaches any 'multiple of 50 minus one', their score is reduced by 49 points.
      * If a player's score reaches 99 points exactly, their score is reduced by 49 points to 50.
      * This increments for every  (i.e. 49, 99, 149, 199, 249, 299...) 
      * side note: it is theoretically possible to reach 99 points which would reduce your tally by -49 to a total of 50; if then you would lose the following round with a single joker in hand (-1 point) your new tally would total 49 points, which would reduce your tally all the way back to zero points. Whether this situation has actually been achieved remains hearsay.

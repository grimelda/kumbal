# gameplay

* Each player gets 7 cards from the deck at the beginning of the game\*, and to start the game the top card on the deck is placed face up on the discard pile.

* The objective is to discard as many points as possible and end up with 7 or fewer points in your hand.
    * Points: joker=0, A=1, 2=2, ..., 9=9, 10=10, J=11, Q=12, K=13

* Every turn you first discard, then you draw the top card from the deck.
    * if you draw a card from the deck that is the same as the oneoyu just discarded, you can discard it 'for free' as long as the next person hasn't played yet (this speeds things up).
    * You are also allowed to pick the top card on the discard pile. 

* You can discard two or more of the same value (doubles, triples, etc: ♣️9 + ♥️9 + ...)

* You can discard 3 or more of a series in the same suit (♣️4, ♣️5, ♣️6, ...)

* Special "pest" cards have additional powers: 
    * 7: reverse order. If played, the game order is reversed.
    * 8: next person is skipped
    * 2: next person to pick 2 (unless they can also discard a 2 or joker, then the amount of picks add up)
    * joker: next person to pick 5 (unless they can also discard a 2 or joker, then the number of to-be-drawn cards add up)

* if you have 7 or fewer points at the beginning of your round, you can call "Kumball". If you indeed have the fewest amount of points, you win and get 0 points, the rest gets the amount of points in hand. If someone else has even fewer points, the one who called Kumball gets the amount of points in hand plus 25 penalty points. 

\* *You can also play with 5 cards in hand and a goal of 5 points or fewer, to make the game faster and this is better for groups of six or larger.*

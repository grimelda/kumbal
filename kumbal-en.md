# kumbal card game rules and gameplay ♣️♦️♠️♥️

* Each player gets 7\* cards from the deck at the beginning of the game, and to start the game the top card on the deck is placed face up on the discard pile.

* The objective is to discard as many points as possible and end up with 7 or fewer points in your hand.
    * Points: joker=0, A=1, 2=2, ..., 9=9, 10=10, J=11, Q=12, K=13

* Every turn you has two steps
   * first discard, 
   * last draw a card.
      * You are also allowed to pick the top card from the discard pile (not the case for jokers and action cards, they are lost when played). 
   * if you wish to call kumbal, this must be done at the start of your turn (not after discarding a card)
   * special cases:
    * if a drawn card from the deck is the same value as the one you just discarded, you can discard it 'for free' as long as the next person hasn't played their turn yet (this speeds things up).

* You can discard two or more of the same value (doubles, triples, etc e.g. ♣️9 + ♥️9...).

* You can discard 3 or more of a series in the same suit (♣️4, ♣️5, ♣️6, ...)
   * joker can be played as another card (but cannot be picked up from the discard pile by next player, similar to action cards)

* If you have 7 or fewer points at the beginning of your round, you can call "Kumbal". If you indeed have the fewest amount of points in hand, you win and get 0 penalty points, the rest gets the amount of penalty points held in hand. 
    * If another player has the same amount, or fewer points than the player who calls Kumbal, the one who called Kumbal gets the amount of points in hand plus 25 penalty points. 

* At the end of each round, all players scores are recorded and added up.
    * The game ends when one person's penalty score surpasses 100 points (or you can continue to 200 or 500 for longer games)
    * If a player's score reaches 49 points exactly, their score is reduced by 49 points to 0.
    * If a player's score reaches 99 points exactly, their score is reduced by 49 points to 50.
    * This increments for 149, 199, 249, 299 points etc each get reduced by 29 points. 
    * side note: it is theoretically possible to get to 99 points, have your number of points reduced by 49 to 50, lose the following round with a single joker in hand (-1 point) and then achieve 49 points, which brings you back to zero points. Whether this situation has actually been achieved remains hearsay.

* To speed up the game even more, instead of shuffling the deck between rounds, the deck can be 'cut' instead. Highly recommended.

* When cards are played as an action card, they cannot be picked up from the discard pile, the following player has to pick from the deck.
   * Action cards:
      * 8: wait, next player in turn is skipped
      * 7: reverses play direction
      * pick up cards:
         * joker: next in play must pick up 5 cards
         * 2: next in play must pick up 2 cards

* Alternative: Special "action" cards have additional powers (note this is not recommended by the Kumball OG 'A' or the Peruvian girls who taught him) : 
   * 8: next person is skipped
   * 7: reverse playing direction
   * 2: next person to pick 2
   * joker: next person to pick 5
      * instead of picking up cards one can play a 2 or joker, in which case the number of cards to be picked up by the next player increases in kind

\*   *You can also play with 5 cards in hand with a goal of 5 points or fewer, to make the game faster (recommended for groups of five or larger)*

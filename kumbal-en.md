* Each player gets 7 cards from the deck at the beginning of the game\*, and to start the game the top card on the deck is placed face up on the discard pile.

* The objective is to discard as many points as possible and end up with 7 or fewer points in your hand.
    * Points: joker=0, A=1, 2=2, ..., 9=9, 10=10, J=11, Q=12, K=13

* Every turn you first discard, then you draw the top card from the deck.
    * if you draw a card from the deck that is the same as the one you just discarded, you can discard it 'for free' as long as the next person hasn't played their turn yet (this speeds things up).
    * You are also allowed to pick the top card from the discard pile (not the case for jokers, they are lost when played). 

* You can discard two or more of the same value (doubles, triples, etc: ♣️9 + ♥️9 + ...).

* You can discard 3 or more of a series in the same suit (♣️4, ♣️5, ♣️6, ...).

* When cards are played as an action card, they cannot be picked up from the discard pile, the following player has to pick from the deck.

* If you have 7 or fewer points at the beginning of your round, you can call "Kumbal". If you indeed have the fewest amount of points in hand, you win and get 0 penalty points, the rest gets the amount of penalty points held in hand. 
    * If another player has fewer points than the player who calls Kumbal, the one who called Kumbal gets the amount of points in hand plus 25 penalty points. 

* At the end of each round, all players scores are recorded and added up.
    * The game ends when one person's penalty score surpasses 100 points.
    * If a player's score reaches 51 points exactly, their score is reduced by 51 points to 0.
    * If a player's score reaches 99 points exactly, their score is reduced by 49 points to 50.

* To speed up the game even more, instead of shuffling the deck between rounds, the deck can be 'cut' instead.

* Alternative: Special "action" cards have additional powers (note this is not recommended by the Kumball OG 'A' or the Peruvian girls who taught him) : 
    * 7: reverse order. If played, the game order is reversed.
    * 8: next person is skipped
    * 2: next person to pick 2 (unless they can also discard a 2 or joker, then the amount of to-be-drawn cards add up)
    * joker: next person to pick 5 (unless they can also discard a 2 or joker, then the number of to-be-drawn cards add up)

\* *You can also play with 5 cards in hand and a goal of 5 points or fewer, to make the game faster and this is better for groups of six or larger.*
